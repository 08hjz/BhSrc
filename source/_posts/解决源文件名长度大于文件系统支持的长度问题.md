>- Create a directory with a single letter name, eg ` D:\a `,Navigate to inside the directory that you want to delete, in this case` D:\very\long\path `
>- Select all (` Ctrl+A `) and Cut (` Ctrl-X `)
>- Navigate to the folder you just createdPaste (` Ctrl-V `)
>- now, move up to the root directory and delete the temp folder, in this case`  D:\a `
